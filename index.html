      <p>In 1998, Brin and Page incorporated Google, Inc. with the initial domain name of "Googol", derived from a
        number that consists of one followed by one hundred zerosâ€”representing the vast amount of data that the search
        engine was intended to explore. Following inception, Page appointed himself as CEO, while Brin, named Google's
        co-founder, served as Google's president.</p>

     <p>By June 2000, Google had indexed one billion Internet URLs (Uniform Resource Locators), making it the most comprehensive search engine on the Web at the time.

        Opener startup which is developing aerial vehicles for consumer travel.</p>

      <p>Page has also invested in flying car startups Kitty Hawk and Opener.</p>

      <p>Page is also interested in the socio-economic effects of advanced intelligent systems and how advanced digital
        technologies can be used to create abundance (as described in Peter Diamandis' book), provide for people's
        needs, shorten the workweek, and mitigate the potential detrimental effects of technological unemployment.</p>

      <p>Page also helped to set up Singularity University, a transhumanist think-tank. Google is one of the
        institution's corporate founders and still funds scholarships at Singularity University.</p>
